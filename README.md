site that's different every time you refresh, almost everything is randomized so there are (far) more pages possible than atoms in the observable universe, which is a lot (:

please be cautious with pressing the buttons, since the URL's are completely random which gives you  0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000847% chance ofbeing brought to a real (and possibly dangerous) site.
i might update it a few times, but there's a high chance i'll just abandon it...

enjoy!!!
